Find smash ultimate tournaments that my favorite players are competing in

## What is this?

Enter a list of my favorite smash players and find out which tournaments they're all competing in together e.g.

```
players = [
    {"gamertag": "Tweek", "id": 15768},
    {"gamertag": "MkLeo", "id": 222927},
    {"gamertag": "Sparg0", "id": 158026},
    {"gamertag": "Light", "id": 158871},
    {"gamertag": "„ÅÇcola", "id": 2691639},

## Output

The output of this is basically to generate a CSV with players and tournaments so we can group by the tournaments and see which ones have most of my favorite players in them e.g. 

```
